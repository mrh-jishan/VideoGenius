/**
 * Core Philosophy: This ruleset enforces a strict, user-centric ownership model. All data entities,
 * including projects, scenes, and image assets, are private and can only be accessed by the user
 * who created them. There is no concept of public or shared data.
 *
 * Data Structure: The entire data model is hierarchical, with all user-generated content nested
 * under the `/users/{userId}` path. This creates a secure data silo for each user, ensuring that
 * one user's data is completely isolated from another's.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Strict Authentication: All read and write operations require a user to be signed in.
 * - Ownership Enforcement: Access is granted by comparing the `request.auth.uid` with the `userId`
 *   wildcard in the document path. This path-based security is simple, fast, and avoids costly
 *   cross-document reads (`get()` calls) for authorization.
 * - No User Listing: To protect user privacy and prevent data scraping, listing documents in the
 *   top-level `/users` collection is explicitly disallowed.
 * - Relational Integrity: On document creation, key identifiers (like `userId` or `projectId`)
 *   in the document's body are validated against the IDs in the path to ensure data consistency.
 *   These identifiers are enforced as immutable on update to prevent re-parenting documents.
 * - Prototyping Flexibility: While authorization and relational integrity are strictly enforced,
 *   the rules do not validate the specific data types or shapes of other fields (e.g., `prompt`,
 *   `duration`), allowing for rapid front-end development and iteration.
